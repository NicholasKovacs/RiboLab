1. Introduction
================
MBEToolbox is a MATLAB toolbox for the sequence data analyses of molecular
biology and evolution. It aims at filling this gap by offering efficient 
implementations of the most needed functions in molecular evolution. It can be 
used to manipulate aligned sequences, calculate evolutionary distances, 
estimate synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates, and infer 
phylogenetic trees. Moreover, it is functional framework extensible for more 
specialized needs in exploring and analyzing aligned nucleotide or protein 
sequences from the evolutionary perspective. The full functions in the toolbox 
are accessible through command-line for those seasoned MATLAB users, yet, it 
does provide a graphical user interface may be especially useful for 
non-specialist end users.

2. Availability
================
MBEToolbox is available at http://bioinformatics.org/mbetoolbox
This software can be used freely for academic, non-profit purposes.

3. Installation (for Windows)
================
1) Requirements: i) MATLAB, version 6.0 and higher; ii) Windows system
2) Download the MBEToolbox_v#.#.zip file.
3) Create a directory called 'mbetoolbox', then unzip the file and copy
   all files there.
4) Adds directory of mbetoolbox to the MATLAB path.

4. How to start?
==================
1) Start up MATLAB. 
2) Run "MBEDEMO" for demos.
3) Type "MBEGUI". If all goes well, this will bring up a menu-driven user 
   interface of the toolbox.
